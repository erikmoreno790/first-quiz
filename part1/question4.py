#
# Instructions:
# Question 4 and Question 5 are about writing SQL. THey use the database that is 
# created in the file `pets_db.py`. 
# These questions use a database called SQLite. You do not need to install anything.
# In the file `pets_db.py` three tables are created. Data is then added to each 
# of the tables. The questions below are about how the data in each of the tables
# is related.

# Part 4.A:
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by nobody.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<pet name>, <species>, <age>)

sql_pets_owned_by_nobody = """

SELECT A.name, A.species, A.age FROM animals A
LEFT JOIN people_animals P ON A.animal_id = P.pet_id
WHERE P.owner_id IS NULL;

"""

# Part 4.B:
# Write SQL to select how the number of pets are older than their owners. 
# The output should be an integer.

sql_pets_older_than_owner = """

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animals A
INNER JOIN people_animals PA ON PA.pet_id = A.animal_id
INNER JOIN people P ON P.person_id = PA.owner_id
WHERE A.age > P.age

"""

# Part 4.C: BONUS CHALLENGE! 
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by Bessie and nobody else.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<person name>, <pet name>, <species>)
sql_only_owned_by_bessie = """
